## What's Next

Roughly in priority order:

1. ~~**Split windows**~~ — ✅ Done
2. **LSP client** — Code intelligence via Language Server Protocol (completion, go-to-definition, diagnostics)
3. **Plugin system** — Elixir-based plugins that run as supervised processes
4. **Additional themes** — Theme loading from disk, runtime switching
5. **Visual block mode** — Column selection and editing
6. **File tree sidebar** — Project navigation panel
7. **Git integration** — Gutter indicators, blame, hunk staging
8. **Terminal emulator** — Embedded terminal in a split

---

## Design Principles

These guide what we build and how:

- **Fault tolerance over speed** — The BEAM's supervision model means crashes are recoverable events, not catastrophes
- **Two-process isolation** — Editor state and rendering never share memory; either can fail independently
- **Vim grammar, modern UX** — Modal editing with discoverable leader-key menus
- **Elixir for logic, Zig for pixels** — Each language where it excels
- **Test everything** — 1,500 tests and counting; property-based tests for data structures
